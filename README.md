## Overview

The **Vera C. Rubin Observatory (LSST)** will discover vastly more time-domain transients than ever before, making full spectroscopic follow-up impossible. This project trains an ML model to classify objects **using only lightcurves**, with emphasis on detecting **TDEs** (a star disrupted by a supermassive black hole).

## Dataset

**MALLORN (Many Artificial LSST Lightcurves based on Observations of Real Nuclear transients)**

- Lightcurves are **simulated LSST observations**
- Simulations are based on **real ZTF** observations
- Additional bands are generated using **SNCosmo**
- LSST cadence is implemented using the **Rubin Survey Simulator baseline**

## Result

- **Best leaderboard score:** `0.6356`
